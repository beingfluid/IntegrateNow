## Chapter 1
# Working with objects

- An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
- A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
- In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.
\

- In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. 
- Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. 
- The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.
\

Compare it with a cup, for example. 
- A cup is an object, with properties. 
- A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. 
\

The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
