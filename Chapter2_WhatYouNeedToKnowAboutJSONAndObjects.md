## What's next?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In next chapter, we are actually starting our adventure in the ServiceNow land. I will explain one of the simplest real life use case and start gathering what all is needed to start implementing it. We will talk about ServiceNow API documentation (REST API Explorer), Will understand how to use it, touch back and expand some of the concepts we saw already and introduce some new ones. It will be fun, if you do it by yourself, if not already.
