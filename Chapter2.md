# Working with JSON


- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
- It is easy for humans to read and write. 
- It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
\
- Though many programming languages support JSON, it is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions.
\
- JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. 
- JSON can represent numbers, booleans, strings, null, arrays (ordered sequences of values), and objects (string-value mappings) made up of these values (or of other arrays and objects).  
\
It is based upon JavaScript syntax but is distinct from it: some JavaScript is not JSON.
- Property names must be double-quoted strings; trailing commas are forbidden.
- Leading zeros are prohibited. A decimal point must be followed by at least one digit. NaN and Infinity are unsupported.
- JSON does not natively represent more complex data types like functions, regular expressions, dates, and so on.
\
### JSON object
- The JSON object contains methods for parsing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and converting values to JSON. 
- It can't be called or constructed, and aside from its two method properties, it has no interesting functionality of its own.
