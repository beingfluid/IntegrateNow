## Chapter 2
# Working with JSON


- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
- It is easy for humans to read and write. 
- It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
\
- Though many programming languages support JSON, it is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions.
\
- JSON can represent numbers, booleans, strings, null, arrays (ordered sequences of values), and objects (string-value mappings) made up of these values (or of other arrays and objects).  
- JSON does not natively represent more complex data types like functions, regular expressions, dates, and so on.
