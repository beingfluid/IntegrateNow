## Chapter 1

# Conceptual Asides

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, I kept myself away from the adventurous and thrilling world of Integrations. However, integration is actually a very simple concept and it is so much fun to do. And ServiceNow is a great tool when it comes to integrating with other tools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ServiceNow community have many great people around the globe, who not only did lot of crazy stuff but also helped many many others like me to understand these concepts. Also ServiceNow itself has a great amount of resources, learning paths, courses and well-structured documentation that you can take advantage of. But sometimes it can be difficult to read and understand all this tech terms of official documentations, And it can be very easy if they are consolidated at one place with practical use cases. Which is exactly the journey I will be taking you all on. Whatever you are going to learn in this journey is not something I came up with, It is already there! But what we will be doing is connecting the dots, going step by step through each concept building on previous ones. In other words, I am going to teach you "How to read the docs", but I promise by end of all these chapters, you will be able to build almost any integration in the world; though I'm going to restrict myself to ServiceNow platform, when explaining all those stuff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, That's a big committement! and in order to make it true, we need to think of some concepts that are essential to understand before we actually dig deeper. Don't worry, we'll go pretty quick through them in this chapter and touch them back once we actually do the tech part.
