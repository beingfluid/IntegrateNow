## A good API Documentation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, I cant resist myself from quoting the famous quote from Dick Brandon :

> Documentation is like sex; when it's good, it's very, very good, and when it's bad, it's better than nothing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important feature of API is it's documentation. Rather you can say, an API is only as good as it's documentation. If you are one of those, who did work or atleast tried to read API references for some tool and have struggled badly understanding it, you probably know it already. A bad documentation makes it hard to understand the artifacts and makes it unnecessarily difficult for you. While in other case, A good documentation explains how to effectively use the API, saves time and efforts, and enhances your development experience.

### What is API documentation?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API documentation is a reference document that outlines how to use the API. It’s a technical manual that contains information about the services the API offers, how to use its various endpoints and parameters, and other implementation instructions. With good API documentation, developers can understand the usage of an API and incorporate it into their use cases without experiencing programming obstacles.

### API Documentation Best Practices

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, you can see the documentions where the APIs are fully documented, but it is still terribly confusing. I would like to name few best practices that makes API documentation great :

- A good documentation is consistent with universally accepted naming conventions and terminologies.
- It uses a language that is simple and easily understandable by users.
- It offers useful, human-readable information about the possible error messages a user may encounter when interacting with your API—besides just correct error codes, to allow users to learn and integrate your technology easily.It also includes explanations on how the errors can be resolved.
- It allows you to test what you read in the documentation and see how it works.
- It includes interactive sample codes in the most popular programming languages to reduce the friction in implementing your API.
- It is constantly updated and remains accurate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important feature that makes a documentation more better is it's user interface, If you don't have a visible user interface and you can't know how to use an API just by looking at it.
